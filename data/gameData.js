          "Ability to persuade and convince people through the right argument and explanation."
        ],
        timeRequired: `First, you should sign up for the Amazon Associate program. You’ll need to provide your website’s name while signing up. Amazon will analyze your website, and if they find it appropriate according to their standards they will approve you as an official Amazon associate. The approval process might take 2 to 5 days. Once you’re approved, find out the relevant products you want to promote on your blog then grab their affiliate links and insert them into your website.`,
        tips: [
          "1.  Dig out relevant products - The first and most important thing is to find out the products that are relevant to your website’s or blog’s content and audience. The more relevant the product, the better chance you’ll have of selling. For example, promoting wristwatches on a blog that teaches people to do Yoga exercises is highly unlikely to make you any sale. But instead, if you try to promote Yoga mats, pants, and books you’ll see great success.",
          "2.  Place affiliate links inside your content - Placing simple text links within the context of an article is the most effective way to get people to click your affiliate links. People trust the body of the content on a page more than any other area of the website. Hence it is very likely that they will click on the link when it’s placed inside the content’s body. For example, “Check out this cool smartwatch. It has retained the position of No 1 bestseller since last two months.”",
          "3.  Link product images to Amazon - Images play an important role in grabbing visitor’s attention. Another simple way to get people to click on your affiliate links is to use lots of high-quality product images and make those images as clickable affiliate links. One good thing about Amazon is that it allows you to freely use any product’s image on your website for promotional purposes.",
          "4.  Write a product review article - Doing a quality product review and writing a great article explaining all the facets of a product is another great way to generate high click-thru rates and sales. But while doing any review make sure it is of high quality and unbiased. People shouldn’t think that you are badly trying to get them to buy the product. A high-quality review should answer all the answers and clear confusion or reservations any potential buyer might have. Make sure your review does cover all the above-mentioned aspects.",
          "5.  Just send people to Amazon - One of the great things about Amazon is that it is very good at converting visitors into buyers. You don’t need to follow them nor target them with ads, Amazon will do the rest for you. All you need to do is send them to Amazon.com through your affiliate link. The great thing about this is when somebody visits Amazon.com through your link you get a percentage of anything they buy for the next 24 hours. For example, if one person clicks on your “Yoga Mat” affiliate link and visits Amazon.com and buys 2 wristwatches instead of a Yoga Mat within 24 hours, you’ll get commissions for the wristwatch sales even if you didn’t promote it directly.",
          "6.  Build loyalty and trust - One major factor that will boost your sales is your reader's’ loyalty and trust towards you and your website. Most of your sales will come people who are loyal and repeat readers. Readers who connect with you on a regular basis, over the long period, begin to trust you and your website. So when you make any recommendation or do a review, they are more likely to take that advice than someone who they don’t trust."

Take 10 minutes to Google your item and uncover its true market value on eBay and other e-commerce sites. This will help you to sell right items more competitively because you’ll have the knowledge of your item’s market and pricing strategies. Also, dig out relevant targeted keywords which will help people to find your items via Google search engine.",

Make sure your title is appealing, complete and you’ve included targeted keywords. You don’t have to be a tech wizard for this. Just ask yourself, what would a potential buyer for this item type into the search box?",
          "Write item’s description - Fill out all the fields in your listing, and make sure your textual description is providing all the information that your potential buyer might look for. Most lazy sellers ignore this and fail badly at selling anything on eBay.",

          "Timing - Most expert sellers use 10-day listings starting on Thursday, you should use it too, it will give you two full weekends of eyeballs. You’ll usually receive the highest traffic on weekends."

        howToMonetize: `Monetization is very simple. More people place orders with you, more money you make.
